        <h1>The article is about the ancient Indian epic: Ramayana</h1>
		<p>One of my favriate book is <b>Ramayana</b> which is written by  <b>Valmiki,</b> it is one of the two major Hindu epics, the other being the Mahabharata, called the Itihasas. It describes the trip taken by Prince Rama to save his bride Sita from the demon king Ravana. It depicts the qualities of dedication, loyalty, and righteousness.</p>
        <p1>The Ramayana is a profound examination of the complexity of human nature as well as a story of bravery and adventure. It explores love, sacrifice, and the never-ending conflict between good and evil. The Ramayana leaves an enduring impression on humanity's collective excited with its unforgettable story and rich characters that transcend time and cultural boundaries.</p1>
